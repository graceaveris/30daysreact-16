**Day Sixteen - 30 days of React challenge - Interactive Map of Northern Europe**

An interactive map of Nothern Europe, collating data from two different API's! Google maps API and https://restcountries.eu/.

**Concepts Explored:**
- Using data from two API's
- Conditional rendering
- Using keys as a safer method of targeting data
- Dealing with a larger and more complex app 

Follow me as I self-learn React.js. Each day for thirty days i'll be creating a simple app and posting about it, (attempting to) explain my code, and discuss what I have learned. By the end of day 30 I hope to have a basic working knowledge of React.js and its applications!
